                <p class="list_detsils">
                    The privacy policy PEACEWORC precludes any kind of misuse of consumer data and ascertains the smooth

                    Express assent should be gotten except if the information is being handled in a severe clinical setting.
                    This assent should be expressed. You will constantly have to get an express assent when your wellbeing
                    or prosperity site/application processes the area of the client, for example, asks the client for the
                    current area. This is the way an iOS application asks the client for the current location.

                    and wellbeing information) should continuously be given to clients before they introduce the

                <p class="list_title">Google Play's User Data Privacy Policy:</p>
                <p class="list_detsils">
                    The Data safety section on Google Play is a simple way for us to help people understand what user data
                    your app collects or shares, as well as showcase your app's key privacy and security practices. This
                    information will help the users make more informed choices when deciding which apps to install. You
                    alone are responsible for making complete and accurate declarations in your app's store listing on
                    Google Play. Google Play reviews apps across all policy requirements; however, we cannot make
                    determinations on behalf of the developers of how they handle user data. Only you possess all the
                    information required to complete the Data safety form. When Google becomes aware of a discrepancy
                    between your app behavior and your declaration, we may take appropriate action, including enforcement
                    action.

                <p class="list_details">
                    In this PEACEWORC app, we are adamant to collaborate with both our clients and Google Play service to
                    provide a better understanding of the usage and efficacy of our app in due course of time.
